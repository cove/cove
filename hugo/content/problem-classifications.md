All problems can be reduced to one of two classes that can be asked as questions:

 1. What factors _need_ to come together to create a desired outcome?
 1. What factors _came_ together to create an outcome?

Where 1 can be thought as the forward view, and 2 the backwards disambiguation (and 2 is
probably less NP hard).

It follows then that 1 is not fully solved if 2 can't be solved, since the outcome of 1 will become
the  problem in 2 at a later time.

Which further follows that the true solution is that includes 1 and 2 at any point in time is the fully
solved solution.
