At the top level, all problems can be reduced to one of two classes of questions:

 1. What factors _need_ to come together to create a desired outcome?
 1. What factors _came_ together to create an outcome?

Where 1 can be thought as the forward view, and 2 the backward disambiguation (and 2 is probably less NP hard).

It follows then that 1 is not solved if 2 can't be solved, since the solution to 1 will become the problem in 2 at a later time.

Which further follows that the true solution is the continuous and unbroken _understanding_ of the constituents, and the apparent forward solution is just a byproduct of understanding and just an inital point of recognition.
