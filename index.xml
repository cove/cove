      <description>A constellation DAG can be thought of as way to share the thought process that everyone already
reasons through before making roadmaps or plans in general.
The key difference between a constellation DAG and simply structuring tasks and ideas onto a graph
is that the nodes don&amp;rsquo;t need to represent tasks, but can be either 1) a milestone, 2) a vague
general goal that will become clearer at a later time, or 3) indeed simply a task.</description>

      <description>At the top level, all problems can be reduced to one of two classes of questions:
 What factors need to come together to create a desired outcome?
 What factors came together to create an outcome?
  Where 1 and 2 can be thought of as forward and backward views (and 2 is probably less NP hard).
It follows then that 1 is not solved if 2 can&amp;rsquo;t be solved, since the solution to 1 will become</description>
