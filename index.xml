      <description>A constellation DAG can be thought of as way to share the thought process that everyone already reasons through before making roadmaps or plans in general.
DAG refers to a directed acyclic graph, which is a graph with arrows connecting points on it to indicate direction, and if you follow the arrows you wonâ€™t end up going in a circle. In other words, at every point you don&amp;rsquo;t need to think about more than the next step.</description>
